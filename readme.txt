Project overview:
Originally I had proposed a project that would simulate a volleyball game with a random number generator and I would place the players in incorrect positions, or in an order that is different from pass, set, hit.
In my project that I was able to turn in, I had only created half of the team, still out of their normal positions, but instead of simulating a full game, I was able to simulate a single rally of one team.

Project Narrative:
Throughout this project, mainly for part 1, I got a lot of help from the blaseball example that you had walked us through earlier in the semester. For the first milestone,
I created the random number generator, as well as the players on the team, placing them in a different order that would put them in the incorrect position than they actually play in real life.
Milestone 2 was entering a function that would allow the code to create a random number and see if each player would end up dropping the ball or continuing the play.
After milestone 2, the only thing that I had to add was a way to force stop the game if the ball was dropped before the last person could touch it. Originally, the game would continue
play even if the second person dropped the ball, which would never happen in a real game situation. It took me a while to figure it out, I attempted to combat the issue, as you suggested in the comments,
with a while loop, but when I attempted that, the code would run until the ball was dropped, meaning that if it wasn't dropped in the first rally, it would run another rally in which someone would drop it.
I scratched the idea of using a while loop, frustrated that it hadn't worked the way that I wanted, and I asked for help. After reaching out to a friend (shoutout Chris Till for the help), and using google
a bit, I was able to submit the code that you now see as my final project. It was a lot of work, and a lot of back and forth trying to make the code do what I wanted it to, but ultimately I am proud that
I was able to create something like this based off of my very limited knowledge of this coding language and help from others. I liked this challenge a lot, and if given more time, I would've like to have
created a whole game out of it.

Corrections:
After milestone 1 you suggested that I switch the file type to a .py file which I literally always forget to do. I forget to do it in HTML too when creating a file for the first time, and then I get frustrated
when it doesn't work and I wonder why and then feel stupid later when I realize. But it's good to remember. After that for the next milestone I created a function that would only play the one side of the court,
as we were limited on time and quite frankly I think I would've been super stressed trying to do a full game in the time we had, so thank you for that suggestion. After milestone 2 you said that I was on the
right track and I just had to create a bit of code that would force stop the program if the ball was dropped before the last person could touch it, which I was already planning on doing. Great minds think alike
I guess. I attempted a while loop as you suggested, but I was having trouble so ultimately I ended up with what I have coded now. I'm proud of my work.
