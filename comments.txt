The first step to revision here is making sure your file is properly named: it needs to be in all lower case, no spaces with a .py ending. Other than that, it seems like you're on the right track here. The next step, I think, is writing a function that will take players as arguments and get them to actually play. I recommend not simulating an entire game: just have one exchange of the ball between two players. Complexity can grow from there.
